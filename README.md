Web site project for Georgia Biology students & teachers. 
Original files from 2004 include inline styles (Yeah, it's really bad.)
This side project will (hopefully) include updated HTML without inline styles, video and ppt presentations for download, online quizzes that will give immediate feedback, practice tests (wth immediate feedback), links to cool online resources, games, and whatever else I can code that would be usefull to teachers or students.
